All it takes is a few short years of inactivity and you can add as much as 50 lbs to your frame. This is a nationwide issue that affects our health as senior citizens, young adults and even our children. The answer is easier said than done, but easily understood. If you eat more calories than you exercise off in a day, you will gain weight. The opposite holds true as well - if you can burn off more than you consume, you will lose weight. You see, losing weight is not rocket science. You can do it if you stick to a program of moderation in food consumption and daily exercise. Below are a few stretch and exercises taken out of the Beginner's Guide to Fitness on the Military.com eBook Fitness Store. Not only will we help you with a program, but assistance is just an email away with Stew Smith - stew@stewsmith.com. Here are five easy stretches and exercises to get the blood flowing. Slightly increasing your level of activity will aid in increasing your energy level. More energy can lead to greater productivity at your job or school work. All it takes is a few minutes a couple times a day to relieve job-related stress, increase your energy level, and ultimately, make you healthier. Before stretching - walk around the office for about 3-5 minutes. Get some water, go to the bathroom... </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Five Key Stretches (do stretches for 15-30 seconds) </strong></p><p><strong>1) Neck Stretches - Slowly tilt your head toward your shoulder and hold for ten seconds each side. Keep this one slow and easy, the neck is very easy to injure. </strong></p><p><strong>2) Arm Shoulders - Pull your arm across your chest, hook your other arm around it to pull the tension out of your upperback and rear shoulders. </strong></p><p><strong>3) Back / Legs - Lean forward at the waist either from the standing position or sitting and bring your chest toward your thighs. Slowly try to straighten your legs - stretching your hamstrings. </strong></p><p><strong>4) Thigh Stretch - Sit on left edge of your chair or stand. Grab your left ankle and pull it upward toward your buttocks. Switch sides. </strong></p><p><strong>5) Calves Stretch - Stand and lean into your desk with your heels on the floor. Bend your knees slightly to stretch your achilles tendons. </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Five Key Exercises </strong></p><p><strong>1) Legs - Squats - Stand in front of your chair and repeat sitting down and standing up 10 times three times a day. </strong></p><p><strong>2) Shoulder Shrugs - Just pull your shoulders as high as you can and roll them forward ten times and backward ten times throughout the day. </strong></p><p><strong>3) Dumbbell Curls - While on the phone, you can grab a dumbbell and do bicep curls for 20 repetitions three times a day. Straighten your arms by your side and bring your hand (dumbbell) to your shoulder. Keep your palms up. Do one at a time if on the phone. </strong></p><p><strong>4) Bench Dips - Using your chair or sturdy table, place your hands on the edge of the object and bend your arms to slowly lower yourself about six inches lower than the seat. Raise yourself by straightening your arms. Repeat this three times a day for 10 repetitions. </strong></p><p><strong>5) Assisted Push-up - In the office, lean up against your desk and push yourself away from the desk while in a leaning position. Repeat this three times a day for 10 repetitions. </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes the office life can wear you down physically. Revive yourself occasionally with a few stretches and basic exercises. Don't let Office Duty make you pay for larger uniforms or new work clothes (unless they are smaller ones!).</strong></p></div>
